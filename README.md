I recently completed a sentiment analysis project on Flipkart reviews for the iPhone 16 128GB model. By leveraging web scraping (using Selenium and BeautifulSoup) and text analysis tools (like TextBlob), I analyzed over 300 customer reviews to gauge public sentiment.

Key Insights:
Positive Sentiment: Most reviews were highly positive, with customers praising the design, camera quality, and battery life.
Challenges: Negative and neutral reviews pointed to issues like pricing and occasional software glitches.
Recommendations: Focus on highlighting positive features in marketing while addressing concerns about software and accessory compatibility.

This analysis provided actionable insights for product improvement and marketing strategies.
